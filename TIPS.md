A few suggestions to get the most out of the problems:

1. **Actually do the problems.** This means writing the code and making it run. Getting stuck can be frustrating, but it's natural and the best way to learn.
2. **Time yourself.** Candidates who solve interview problems quickly are more likely to cinch the interview.
3. **Think of edge cases** and run your code through them. Some good edge cases might be the empty case, weird inputs, or a really large input.
4. Once you've made sure **your code passes all your tests**, try explaining your algorithm to a colleague or friend.
5. You could also start a **mini-discussion group with your friends** to discuss each day's problem.
6. **Forward a problem** to people you think might enjoy it, and discuss potential solutions with them.
